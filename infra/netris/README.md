# netris-test-infra

Ansible automation to deploy OCP SNO on a [Netris Spectrum-X simulated lab](https://github.com/danmanor/netris-lab) and run OSAC VMaaS/CaaS/BMaaS end-to-end tests.

## Architecture

The [netris-lab](https://github.com/danmanor/netris-lab) deploys a full simulated Spectrum-X GPU cluster network on a single bare-metal host using KVM/libvirt:

- **Netris controller** on K3s — manages all network devices via REST/gRPC API
- **~13 switch VMs** (Cumulus Linux) — leaf/spine fabric for North-South connectivity
- **4 softgate VMs** — provide NAT/L4LB and BGP peering for internet access
- **4 server VMs** (hgx-00 to hgx-03) — simulated GPU servers, managed by Netris

This repo takes the first server (hgx-00), resizes it for OCP, configures Netris networking (VPC, VNet, Subnet), and installs OpenShift SNO on it using the Assisted Installer. For CaaS, the remaining three servers are prepared as BMaaS hosts and selected by BMH labels. OSAC creates the ClusterOrder InfraEnv in the workload namespace and passes its ignition to worker provisioning, so each Agent registers directly in the namespace the order reconciler watches. MaaS retains the shared discovery-InfraEnv flow for selecting its worker hosts.

```

```

Internet access for OCP image pulls flows through: hgx-00 → NS VNet → softgate SNAT → host iptables masquerade → internet.

## Prerequisites

- **Bare-metal host** running a RHEL-family distribution (RHEL, Rocky Linux, CentOS Stream, or Fedora) with KVM support
- **System packages** — `dnf install -y git make python3-pip ansible-core && /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --ignore-installed ansible`. `make setup-infra` then installs the rest of the BM bootstrap (`sshpass`, `tmux`, `policycoreutils-python-utils`), EPEL from the Fedora URL (required on RHEL), and the Python dependencies into the Ansible interpreter's environment.
- **Resources**: ~32+ CPU cores, 128+ GB RAM (lab VMs + OCP SNO VM)
- **Storage**: ~400GB+ for OCP disk images, K3s, and containers. If the root partition is smaller, use a secondary data disk and enable automatic provisioning with `disk_setup_enabled=true` (via `EXTRA_VARS` or in the config). Run `make disk-setup` standalone or pass the variable during setup: `make setup-infra EXTRA_VARS="disk_setup_enabled=true"`
- **Netris license key** — place at repo root as `license.key`
- **OSAC/AAP license** — place at repo root as `license.zip`
- **OpenShift pull secret** — place at `/root/pull-secret` (or set `pull_secret_path`; download from [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads))
- **Config file** — place `infra/netris/config` (INI format, gitignored) with your lab name and AWS credentials. AWS credentials can be obtained from the [CI vault](https://vault.ci.openshift.org/ui/vault/secrets/kv/kv/selfservice%2Fosac%2Fpacket-osac). See Quick Start below. The IAM user needs `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets`, `route53:ListHostedZones`, and `route53:GetChange` permissions on the hosted zone.

All system packages, tools, and SSH keys are installed automatically by `make setup-infra`. A pre-flight check validates all required files, KVM support, and minimum memory before deploying.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/danmanor/netris-test-infra.git
cd netris-test-infra

# Place prerequisites
cp /path/to/license.key ./license.key
cp /path/to/license.zip ./license.zip
cp /path/to/pull-secret /root/pull-secret

# Create infra/netris/config (unique lab name and AWS credentials)
# lab_name becomes a subdomain under the shared hosted zone (e.g., jsmith.ecoeng-osac-ci.devcluster.openshift.com)
cat > infra/netris/config << EOF
[default]
lab_name = <unique-lab-name>
aws_access_key_id = <your-key>
aws_secret_access_key = <your-secret>
aws_region = us-east-1
netris_password = <your-netris-password>
EOF

# Install prerequisites and cache images (shared, run once)
make setup-infra

# Full deployment — installs OCP + OSAC from scratch
make deploy

# OR: Fast deployment (~25 min) — uses a pre-built snapshot with recert.
# Faster but doesn't test the OCP or OSAC installer flows.
make deploy-fast

# Then run a test flow
make setup-caas    # CaaS setup: prelabel BMHs and publish worker catalog; no shared discovery boot
make deploy-caas   # CaaS: create cluster
```

`deploy-caas` creates the ClusterOrder in the workload namespace. OSAC then
creates that order's InfraEnv and provisions the selected BMaaS hosts with its
ignition. Those workers register as Agents in the order namespace; the Netris
AAP role maps their inventory hostnames to server names using the patterns
added to `NETRIS_RESOURCE_CLASS_MAP` by `setup-caas`.

After deployment, the kubeconfig is at `/root/.kube/config`.

## Make Targets

### Deploy

| Target | Description | Time |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `make deploy` | Full pipeline: deploy-infra → deploy-ocp → deploy-osac (fresh Helm install) | ~2-3 hrs |
| `make deploy-fast` | Snapshot pipeline: deploy-infra → deploy-ocp → deploy-osac (snapshot refresh) | ~25 min |
| `make setup-infra` | Install prerequisites, cache images + snapshot flavor, build tools | ~10 min |
| `make deploy-infra` | Deploy netris-lab (K3s, topology, VMs, connectivity) | ~12 min |
| `make deploy-ocp` | Configure Netris networking + restore OCP SNO from snapshot | ~15 min |
| `make deploy-osac` | Prepare OSAC values + Helm install or snapshot refresh (based on `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE`) | ~30-60 min |

### CaaS (run after deploy)

| Target | Description | Time |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `make setup-caas` | Label the configured BMaaS BareMetalHosts, ask Metal3 to power them off, validate worker inventory, ensure shared CaaS catalog entries, and configure the OSAC CLI | ~30 min |
| `make deploy-caas` | Create CaaS cluster using `ocp_ci_small` template | ~60 min |
| `make setup-maas` | Same as setup-caas with MaaS host type / sizing; labels only `MAAS_LABEL_HOSTNAMES` (default h02+h03) with `g5` | ~30 min |
| `make deploy-maas` | Create MaaS cluster (`ocp_4_20_ai_maas` + `-p` template params) | ~60 min |

For CaaS, `setup-caas` maps the configured VM names to BMaaS BareMetalHosts in
`host-inventory` and applies the BareMetalInstanceType selector labels. It asks
Metal3 to power off those hosts (`spec.online: false`) and waits for that power
state before resetting their VM disks. This avoids Metal3 immediately powering
the VMs back on after a host-side shutdown. It does not boot an Assisted ISO or
create discovery Agents. BMF allocates from the labeled BMHs when OSAC provisions
the ClusterOrder's worker BMIs; that provisioning sets the BMH online and passes
the order InfraEnv ignition as user data.

OSAC creates the ClusterOrder-specific InfraEnv in the ClusterOrder namespace
and passes its ignition as worker BMI user data. Metal3 first boots its IPA
ramdisk to install the BMI; the lifecycle NIC stays attached for that step.
The installed worker then boots with the order ignition, and Assisted Service
creates its Agent in the order namespace.
When workers boot the order InfraEnv as Metal3 live ISOs, the diagnostics
helper ejects each virtual-media ISO after its Assisted Agent connects. The
sushy-tools libvirt BMC applies boot-device overrides continuously; without
ejection, Assisted's post-install reboot returns to the ISO instead of the
installed disk.
For the CI workflow that namespace is `osac-e2e-ci`. The Netris AAP role maps
those Agents' inventory hostnames to Netris server names using the optional
`agent_server_name_patterns` in `NETRIS_RESOURCE_CLASS_MAP`, then labels the
Agents before creating the fabric resources. MaaS continues to boot the shared
InfraEnv in `hardware-inventory` to identify its candidate hosts. Worker
diagnostics identify the order namespace for CaaS and `hardware-inventory` for
MaaS. Failure artifacts collect the order InfraEnv, Agents, ClusterOrder,
worker BMIs and selected BMH statuses. It records Agents, InfraEnvs and events
from the order, agent and shared discovery namespaces, including Kubernetes
creation timestamps, and summarizes any selected BMH that received no BMI
assignment. The Netris workflow starts
serial-console capture before ClusterOrder provisioning and stops it after
deployment/tests; each console log records when the VM was first observed
running. Its `caas/worker-diagnostics/` artifact directory contains those boot
logs, the redacted resource snapshots, and the related AAP job stdout and
failed-task events collected by a focused redacting step. The
`aap-capture-status.json` and `osac-artifact-copy-status.json` manifests record
whether each diagnostic collection completed. The infrastructure artifact
also includes redacted K3s Helm installer pod logs and warning events at
`lab/k3s/helm-installer-diagnostics.txt`.

### Destroy

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make destroy-full` | Tear down everything: OSAC + OCP artifacts + netris-lab |
| `make destroy-osac` | Tear down OSAC: helm releases, operators, CRDs, namespaces |
| `make destroy-ocp` | Reset OCP for reinstall: delete cluster, recreate disk, boot VM |
| `make destroy-infra` | Tear down netris-lab (VMs, K3s, topology) |
| `make destroy-caas` | CaaS/MaaS teardown: stop worker VMs, remove disks/ISO, let OSAC remove CaaS order resources, delete shared discovery resources in MaaS mode, clean DNS |
| `make force-destroy-caas` | destroy-caas + strip stuck orders/namespaces, wipe VMs, Netris orphans |
| `make destroy-maas` | destroy-caas with MaaS cluster/host-type overrides |
| `make force-destroy-maas` | force-destroy-caas with MaaS overrides |
| `make destroy-bmaas` | BMaaS teardown: remove BMH/K8s resources, stop BMaaS VMs, clean disks, delete BMH namespace |

### Recovery and Utilities

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make connectivity` | Re-run lab connectivity (VPN, BGP, softgates) without full redeploy |
| `make run-osac-setup` | Re-run just `make install` in osac-installer (after prep-osac has run) |
| `make prep-osac` | Ansible-only OSAC prep (clone, patch values, copy secrets) — no Helm install |
| `make post-osac` | Scale down MCE operators and filter OS images to target version |
| `make vendor-update` | Refresh vendored Ansible collections |
| `make lint` | Run ansible-lint |
| `make gather-infra` | Gather diagnostic info from the cluster |

### Typical Workflows

**First deploy on a fresh server (fast path — snapshot):**
```bash
make setup-infra          # install prerequisites, cache images + snapshot flavor, build tools
make deploy-fast    # deploy lab + OCP+OSAC from snapshot (~25 min total)
```

**First deploy on a fresh server (full path — from scratch):**
```bash
make setup-infra          # install prerequisites, cache images, build tools
make deploy         # deploy lab + OCP + OSAC (~2-3 hrs)
```

**Fast deploy with image overrides (test a PR build):**
```bash
make deploy-fast EXTRA_VARS="fulfillment_service_image=quay.io/osac/fulfillment-service:pr-123"
```

**Deploy with BMaaS values and image overrides:**
```bash
make deploy-ocp
make deploy-osac OSAC_VALUES_FILE=values/bmaas-ci/values.yaml \
  EXTRA_VARS="osac_operator_image=quay.io/dmanor/osac-operator:tag bmf_operator_image=quay.io/dmanor/bare-metal-fulfillment-operator:tag bare_metal_services=true aap_project_git_branch=my-feature-branch"
make setup-bmaas
```

> `aap_project_git_branch` (and `aap_project_git_uri`) point the AAP config-as-code project
> at a specific branch, so AAP syncs osac-aap playbooks/collections from that branch at
> runtime. This is separate from `osac_branch`, which only controls the mono-repo clone used
> for the installer Helm charts — to fully test a PR whose changes include osac-aap Ansible,
> set both `osac_branch` and `aap_project_git_branch` to the PR branch.

**Re-deploy OSAC after code changes:**
```bash
make destroy-osac   # tear down OSAC (keeps OCP and lab)
make deploy-osac    # redeploy
```

**Re-install OCP (e.g., different version):**
```bash
make destroy-ocp    # delete cluster, recreate disk
make deploy-ocp     # reinstall
```

**Fix lab connectivity issues (e.g., softgate/E-BGP):**
```bash
make connectivity   # re-runs VPN, socat, ISP FRR, softgate agents
```

**Deploy CaaS after OSAC is up:**
```bash
make setup-caas     # prelabel CaaS BMHs, register worker inventory
make deploy-caas    # create cluster
```

**Deploy MaaS after OSAC is up:**
```bash
make setup-maas     # shared discovery path; labels only MAAS_LABEL_HOSTNAMES (default h02+h03) with g5
make deploy-maas    # create cluster with ocp_4_20_ai_maas + enable_* params
```

**Rebuild from scratch:**
```bash
make destroy-full   # tear down everything
make deploy-fast    # full redeploy (snapshot path)
```

**BM full pipeline (redeploy-server.sh):**
```bash
# CaaS + fresh OSAC install (default)
make redeploy-fresh

# CaaS + snapshot OSAC refresh (same mode as deploy-fast)
make redeploy-fresh OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE=snapshot

# MaaS + snapshot refresh (grows h00 disk; setup-maas / deploy-maas)
make redeploy-fresh SUITE=maas OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE=snapshot
```

### Bare-Metal Lab Deployment (from laptop)

For persistent bare-metal servers behind NAT (e.g., Red Hat lab infrastructure), use the remote deploy workflow. This handles image caching, bootstrapping, and resilient multi-step deploys from your laptop.

**One-time setup:**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/osac-project/osac-test-infra.git
cd osac-test-infra/infra/netris

# Create env file from template (one per server, gitignored)
cp scripts/env.sh.example scripts/env.sh
# Edit scripts/env.sh with: SERVER IP, PASSWORD, LAB_NAME, secrets paths, AWS keys
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
source scripts/env.sh && make deploy-jump
```

This single command:
1. Pre-caches container images on your laptop (with retries, avoids rate limits)
2. Rsyncs the repo + cached images to the server
3. Bootstraps packages (EPEL, Ansible, pip deps)
4. Sets up data disk (partition, mount, symlinks, SELinux)
5. Destroys any previous deployment
6. Runs the full pipeline: setup-infra → deploy-infra → deploy-ocp → deploy-osac → setup-caas → deploy-caas → post-install

**Monitor:**
```bash
ssh root@$SERVER -t tmux attach -t deploy
ssh root@$SERVER tail -f /root/deploy.log
```

**Multiple servers:** Create one env file per server (`scripts/env-mylab.sh`), then:
```bash
source scripts/env-mylab.sh && make deploy-jump
```

**BM-specific make targets (run on server):**

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make redeploy-fresh` | Destroy + wipe progress + full pipeline (`SUITE`, `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE`) |
| `make redeploy-continue` | Resume failed redeploy from last incomplete step |
| `make disk-setup` | Auto-detect and mount data disk |
| `make post-install` | Fix Keycloak/UI + generate access doc |
| `make access-doc` | Generate handover documentation only |
| `make health-check` | Quick status verification |

`redeploy-server.sh` steps: `setup-infra` → `deploy-infra` → `deploy-ocp` → `deploy-osac` → `setup-caas|setup-maas` → `deploy-caas|deploy-maas` → `post-install`. Pass `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE=snapshot` (or `--snapshot`) for refresh instead of Helm install; default is `fresh`.

See the PR description for known issues and workarounds specific to BM/RHEL environments.

## Accessing OCP Routes

After `make deploy-osac`, a socat forwarder on port 9444 provides access to OCP routes (AAP UI, OCP console, fulfillment API) from external browsers. Port 443 is intercepted by K3s svclb (Netris controller), so 9444 is used instead.

Add to your local `/etc/hosts`:
```
<server-ip>  osac-aap-osac-devel.apps.ocp-sno.osac.local
<server-ip>  console-openshift-console.apps.ocp-sno.osac.local
<server-ip>  fulfillment-api-osac-devel.apps.ocp-sno.osac.local
```

Then browse to `https://osac-aap-osac-devel.apps.ocp-sno.osac.local:9444` (accept the self-signed cert).

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| AAP UI | `https://osac-aap-osac-devel.apps.ocp-sno.osac.local:9444` |
| OCP Console | `https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp-sno.osac.local:9444` |
| Assisted Installer UI | `http://<server-ip>:8080` |
| Netris Controller | `http://<server-ip>:9443` |

## How deploy-ocp Works

`make deploy-ocp` deploys OCP SNO from a pre-built VM snapshot. It uses a golden qcow2 disk image (cached during `make setup-infra`) and regenerates the cluster's identity (certificates, hostname, IP, domain) using [recert](https://github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/recert). In `fresh` mode, it uses the `sno-4-22` flavor (OCP only, no OSAC); in `snapshot` mode, the `caas` flavor (OCP+OSAC baked in).

The flow runs three Ansible roles in sequence:

1. **`configure-netris`** — creates VPC, VNet (DHCP disabled), subnet, SNAT/DNAT rules via Netris API
2. **`configure-dns`** — creates Route 53 DNS records and local dnsmasq config for the cluster domain
3. **`restore-ocp`** — creates copy-on-write disk overlays backed by the cached flavor, mounts the OS disk via qemu-nbd to write pre-boot config (hostname, nodeip hint, dnsmasq overrides, nmstate config for static IP, OVN/OVS cleanup), runs recert (via JSON config file, matching LCA's approach) to regenerate all TLS certificates and cluster identity, then waits for cluster health. When `suite=maas` (via `SUITE=maas`), also grows the h00 OS disk to `ocp_snapshot_disk_gb` before pre-boot config.

The snapshot flavor is pulled and cached during `make setup-infra` (one-time ~60GB download). Subsequent deploys use copy-on-write overlays, so only changed blocks are written.

OSAC itself is handled by `make deploy-osac` (not part of `deploy-ocp`). In `OSAC_DEPLOY_MODE=snapshot`, that runs `refresh-osac` → `post-refresh-osac` → **`patch-osac-refresh`**, which wires Netris/SSH/socat and then applies `config-as-code-ig`’s `AAP_PROJECT_GIT_*` pin onto the live AAP Project and launches `osac-config-as-code` once (snapshot AAP DB keeps the bake-time `scm_branch`; waiting for the hourly CaC schedule is too late for `setup-maas` / `publish-templates`).

## How deploy-osac Works

`make deploy-osac` runs in three phases:

1. **`prep-osac`** (Ansible) — clones the osac mono-repo, resolves the OCP release CLI image, patches the Helm values file with all CI-specific settings (Netris controller URL/credentials, DNS/AWS settings, SSH keys, instance group config for cluster/network fulfillment), enables required operators (LVMS, MetalLB, CNV, MCE, bundled PostgreSQL), copies license and pull secret to the values directory, and sets up a socat forwarder for OCP ingress on port 9444.

2. **`run-osac-setup`** (shell) — runs `make install` in the osac-installer directory, which executes three Helm install phases:
   - **Phase 1** (`install-operators`) — installs OLM subscriptions for cert-manager, AAP, LVMS, MetalLB, CNV, and MCE via the `osac-operators` chart
   - **Phase 2** (`install-prereqs`) — deploys Keycloak, CA certificates, trust-manager bundles, and operator CRD instances via the `osac-prereqs` chart
   - **Phase 3** (`install-osac`) — deploys the OSAC umbrella chart (osac-operator, fulfillment-service, osac-aap, osac-ui) with post-install hooks for hub creation and template publishing

3. **`post-osac`** (Ansible) — skipped in fresh mode. In snapshot mode, scales down MCE operators and filters `OS_IMAGES` to only the target OCP version.

## Configuration

All parameters are in [`inventory/group_vars/all.yml`](inventory/group_vars/all.yml). Override any variable via `EXTRA_VARS`:

```bash
make deploy-ocp EXTRA_VARS="ocp_version=4.22"
make deploy-osac EXTRA_VARS='{"osac_branch": "feature-x"}'
```

### Key Variables

| `lab_name` | `$LAB_NAME` or `default` | Per-lab subdomain prefix (avoids DNS collisions) |
| `dns_hosted_zone` | `ecoeng-osac-ci.devcluster.openshift.com` | Route 53 hosted zone |
| `ocp_base_domain` | `<lab_name>.<dns_hosted_zone>` | DNS base domain (derived) |
| `ocp_server_vcpu` | `20` | OCP VM vCPUs |
| `ocp_server_memory_gb` | `64` | OCP VM RAM (GB) |
| `ocp_subnet_cidr` | `192.168.40.0/24` | OCP VNet subnet |
| `ocp_dnat_ip` | `198.51.100.2` | DNAT IP for OCP API/apps access |
| `osac_namespace` | `osac-e2e-ci` | OSAC Kubernetes namespace |
| `osac_values_file` | `values/caas-ci/values.yaml` | Helm values file |
| `osac_branch` | `main` | osac mono-repo branch |
| `netris_username` | `netris` | Netris API username |
| `netris_password` | *(required)* | Netris API password — set in your local config, validated at deploy time |
| `ew_fabric_enable` | `0` | East-West fabric (0=NS only) |
| `dns_server` | `8.8.8.8` | Public resolver for lab guests (switches/softgates) so ZTP/agent installs can resolve public hosts; must be reachable from the guests. The management VM bootstrap interface uses `mgmt_server_dns` |
| `mgmt_server_dns` | `192.168.122.1` | Resolver for the management VM's libvirt NAT interface, used for package and cloud-init downloads |
| `softgate_bootstrap_dns` | `8.8.8.8` | Public resolver for SoftGate cloud-init and Netris agent installation (must resolve get.netris.io / archive.ubuntu.com); SoftGates restore `dns_server` for runtime after install |
| `k3s_dns_server` | First non-loopback resolver in host `/etc/resolv.conf` | Resolver for K3s pods; set explicitly if the host resolver is not reachable from pods |
| `caas_cluster_template` | `osac.templates.ocp_ci_small` | Cluster template for CaaS cluster creation |
| `caas_cluster_name` | `caas-ci-cluster` | CaaS cluster name |
| `caas_host_type_id` | `ci-worker` | Resource-class name; selected BMHs receive this value in the BareMetalInstanceType selector label |
| `caas_cluster_baremetal_instance_type` | `ci-worker` | Shared BareMetalInstanceType ensured by `setup-caas`; independent of the HostType/resource class |
| `caas_cluster_baremetal_instance_type_host_labels` | `osac.openshift.io/resource_class: ci-worker` | Inventory host selector stored in the instance type and applied to selected BMHs; defaults to the configured resource class |
| `caas_cluster_baremetal_instance_type_network_ports` | `eth9` fabric port | Hardware network ports stored in the instance type; defaults to the BM provisioning fabric port |
| `snapshot_flavor_image` | `quay.io/osac-project/cluster-flavors:caas` | OCI image containing the snapshot flavor |
| `snapshot_osac_namespace` | `osac-e2e-ci` | OSAC namespace baked into the snapshot |
| `snapshot_osac_values_file` | `values/caas-ci/values.yaml` | Helm values file for OSAC refresh |

`setup-caas` creates the shared worker BareMetalInstanceType when absent and
validates it before cluster creation. CPU and memory follow
`caas_discovery_vcpu` and `caas_discovery_memory_mb`. Network port names are
Netris server ports (for example, `eth9`), while `caas_netris_vpc_interfaces`
contains Linux interface names (for example, `ens6`). Keep the first fabric
port aligned with `bmaas_provisioning_fabric_iface`. Existing types with
different hardware or host selectors fail validation; choose a new type name
when changing immutable hardware. Both the resource class and instance type
are registered in `NETRIS_RESOURCE_CLASS_MAP` when missing. `setup-caas` also
adds `agent_server_name_patterns`, which maps order-bound Agent inventory
hostnames to their Netris server names when the Agents do not already carry
`netris.server/name` labels.

```bash
make deploy-ocp EXTRA_VARS="ocp_version=4.18"
make setup-caas EXTRA_VARS="caas_cluster_name=my-cluster caas_discovery_vcpu=8"

# MaaS: default 10 vCPU / 20GiB for h02–h03; h01 stays 4 vCPU / 16GiB via overrides.
# Grow workers only (e.g. real model headroom) without resizing h01:
make setup-maas MAAS_DISCOVERY_MEMORY_MB=49152
```

| `ocp_snat_ip` | `198.51.100.1` | SNAT translated IP | defaults only |
| `ocp_dnat_ip` | `198.51.100.2` | DNAT IP for API/apps access | defaults only |
| `osac_external_ip_pool_cidr` | `198.51.100.24/29` | OSAC tenant ExternalIPPool CIDR; host routes/masquerades it toward the softgate. Must not overlap the mgmt nat/l4lb/bgp pools. OSAC creates the Netris allocation itself. | defaults only |
| `netris_username` | `netris` | Netris API username | defaults only |
| `netris_password` | *(required)* | Netris API password — no default, set in local config | yes |
| `dns_server` | `8.8.8.8` | Public resolver for lab guests (switches/softgates); must be reachable from the guests so ZTP/agent installs resolve public hosts. OCP api/*.apps records are served by the lab dnsmasq (configure-dns), not this resolver. mgmt-server bootstrap uses `mgmt_server_dns` | yes |
| `mgmt_server_dns` | `192.168.122.1` | Resolver for mgmt-server's `ens3` libvirt NAT interface during package bootstrap | defaults only |
| `softgate_bootstrap_dns` | `8.8.8.8` | Public resolver used by SoftGate cloud-init and agent installation (must resolve public installer hosts); SoftGates restore `dns_server` for runtime after install | defaults only |
| `k3s_dns_server` | First non-loopback resolver in host `/etc/resolv.conf` | K3s pod resolver; override if the host's upstream resolver is unreachable from pods | defaults only |

`dns_server` configures DNS for isolated Netris/CaaS networks, including
topology, DHCP, and OCP NMState. `mgmt_server_dns` configures the management
VM's `ens3` interface on libvirt NAT so cloud-init can reach Ubuntu package
repositories and the OpenVPN config host. `softgate_bootstrap_dns` is used only
while SoftGate cloud-init installs the Netris agent; it must be a public
resolver (default `8.8.8.8`, reached via the mgmt-server NAT) because the
installer resolves public hosts (get.netris.io, archive.ubuntu.com). It is
intentionally not `dns_server`, which is an internal resolver; SoftGates
restore `dns_server` for runtime once the agent is installed. The management
VM's default is the libvirt gateway's DNS proxy. K3s pods use the lab host's first non-loopback
resolver; set `k3s_dns_server` explicitly if that resolver cannot be reached
from pods. Override these values per run with `EXTRA_VARS`:

```bash
# Lab guest/Netris DNS resolver
make deploy EXTRA_VARS="dns_server=10.0.0.1"

# Management VM bootstrap DNS resolver
make deploy-infra EXTRA_VARS="mgmt_server_dns=192.168.122.1"

# SoftGate bootstrap DNS resolver (public; defaults to 8.8.8.8)
make deploy-infra EXTRA_VARS="softgate_bootstrap_dns=1.1.1.1"

# K3s pod resolver, when the host's resolver is not reachable from pods
make deploy-infra EXTRA_VARS="k3s_dns_server=172.31.0.2"
```

`deploy-caas` creates the Fulfillment tenant if absent and waits up to roughly
10 minutes for tenant synchronization and default networking readiness before
creating the cluster. A failed tenant or default networking resource stops
the wait early. The existing OSAC `admin` service account authenticates these
requests; no additional credentials are needed.

Cluster commands use a separate saved CLI tenant configuration because some
CLI versions read `metadata.tenant` from that configuration during creation.
Without it, admin requests default to `shared`, where worker BareMetalInstances
cannot be created. Catalog resources such as BareMetalInstanceType and DiskImage
remain shared. After creation or reuse, deployment checks the cluster's actual
tenant before waiting for cluster readiness.

Cluster lookup and the API delete in `destroy-caas` match both
`caas_cluster_name` and `caas_cluster_tenant`. Pass the same tenant override to
deployment and teardown. A same-name cluster in another tenant, including one
left in `shared` by an earlier run, is not reused or deleted by this lookup.
The worker VM/InfraEnv cleanup and `force-destroy-caas` still operate on the
configured lab resources; they are not general tenant-scoped cleanup tools.

## Testing OSAC Components

All components live in the osac mono-repo. Override `osac_branch` to test a specific branch, and use image variables to override container images.

### CaaS Netris CI revision selection

The **E2E CaaS Netris Full Install** workflow resolves `osac-repo` and
`osac-branch` once to a commit. By default it builds fulfillment-service,
osac-operator, osac-aap, and bare-metal-fulfillment-operator from that commit
and loads them onto the SNO node. The tests, CLI, installer charts/CRDs, and
AAP project playbooks use the same commit. For a branch run, set those two
inputs and leave `components` as `[]`; no image inputs are required.

Explicit registry image inputs replace the corresponding default builds.
Explicit `components` entries override default builds by `imageKey` and take
precedence over registry image inputs. Such overrides must remain compatible
with the selected revision's CRDs. The source build step has a 60-minute limit
for the four components.

The workflow requires the preliminary CaaS cluster to become `READY` before
starting pytest. A `FAILED` state stops the wait immediately; an exhausted
readiness wait or repeated API errors also fail deployment. OSAC diagnostics
run after an attempted OSAC deployment even if deployment or cluster creation
fails. For Netris CaaS, the worker snapshot supplies related AAP job IDs to a
focused collector; its redacted stdout and failed-task event files are included
in `caas-netris-artifacts`, even if the broader OSAC artifact upload is
unavailable. The OSAC artifact also collects AAP output when that collection
completes.

> **Note**: `OSAC_VALUES_FILE` is a **Make-level** variable (not an Ansible `EXTRA_VARS` key). It controls which Helm values file is used for both `prep-osac` and `run-osac-setup`. Pass it directly to `make`, not inside `EXTRA_VARS`. Default: `values/caas-ci/values.yaml`.

### Examples

**Test a feature branch:**
```bash
make destroy-osac
make deploy-osac EXTRA_VARS='{"osac_branch": "feature-x"}'
```

**Test with image overrides:**
```bash
make destroy-osac
make deploy-osac EXTRA_VARS='{"osac_operator_image": "quay.io/osac-project/osac-operator:pr-42", "osac_aap_image": "quay.io/osac-project/osac-aap-ee:pr-99"}'
```

**Test BMaaS with custom operator images:**
```bash
make destroy-osac
make deploy-osac OSAC_VALUES_FILE=values/bmaas-ci/values.yaml \
  EXTRA_VARS="osac_operator_image=quay.io/dmanor/osac-operator:tag bmf_operator_image=quay.io/dmanor/bare-metal-fulfillment-operator:tag bare_metal_services=true"
```
