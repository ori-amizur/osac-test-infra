# reap-orphans.sh -- Find and terminate ephemeral EC2 instances that are no
# longer legitimately in flight, independent of whether the workflow run
# that created them is still capable of tearing them down itself.
#
# e2e-ec2-runner.yml's own teardown job (if: always()) handles the normal
# case, but that only runs at all if the provision/test jobs reach a
# terminal state that lets `needs: [provision, test]` resolve. A cancelled
# run, an orchestrator crash mid-job, or a GitHub outage can all break that
# chain and strand a real, billed c5n.metal instance with nothing watching
# it. This script is the independent backstop, run on a schedule.
#
# Detection logic -- either check alone is sufficient to terminate:
#   1. Run-completed check (precise, fires fast): every ephemeral instance
#      is tagged osac-run-id=<github.run_id>-<github.run_attempt> (see
#      provision.sh's --tag-specifications). If the corresponding GitHub
#      Actions run has already reached status=completed, teardown.sh should
#      already have run -- an instance still alive at that point is
#      orphaned by definition, regardless of how young it is.
#   2. Max-age check (safety net for anything check 1 misses -- a gh API
#      lookup failure, a malformed/missing tag, or a run somehow still
#      in_progress far past any reasonable bound): terminate anything older
#      than MAX_INSTANCE_AGE_MINUTES regardless of what check 1 found.
#
# Every instance examined is logged either way (terminate + reason, or
# "still within bounds, skipping") -- no silent skips.
#
# Also attempts (best-effort) to deregister any lingering GitHub runner
# whose label matches the terminated instance's run-id tag, mirroring
# teardown.sh's own defensive deregistration.
#
# Required env vars:
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY  owner/repo to query/deregister runners against
#   GH_TOKEN           real PAT/GitHub App token with Administration: write
#                      on this repo (used by `gh`) -- see verify-and-register.sh
#                      for why this can't be github.token
#
# Optional env vars:
#   MAX_INSTANCE_AGE_MINUTES  safety-net threshold (default 720). The
#                      provision/push-secrets/test/teardown job timeouts sum
#                      to 670 minutes (test alone is 600m/10h), but
#                      LaunchTime (what age is measured from) occurs partway
#                      into provision. The 720-minute threshold leaves 50
#                      minutes above the configured job timeouts, plus the
#                      provision time before launch; queue time for later
#                      jobs consumes some of that margin.
#                      The watchdog itself shares the singleton
#                      osac-ci-orchestrator runner slot with provision and
#                      teardown, though each watchdog run only occupies it
#                      for seconds.
#                      tune via this workflow's max-age-minutes dispatch
#                      input once more real run data exists.
#   DRY_RUN            "true" to log what would happen without terminating
#                      instances or deregistering runners (default "false")
#   AWS_REGION         defaults to the AWS CLI's configured region
