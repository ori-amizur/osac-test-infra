# start-runner.sh -- Install and start the GitHub Actions runner binary on a
# freshly-provisioned, JIT-registered ephemeral EC2 box.
#
# generate-jitconfig (see verify-and-register.sh) only mints a config token --
# it does not install or start a runner process. Without this step nothing on
# the box is listening for the scheduled job. The runner must keep running
# after this script's SSH session ends, so it's installed as a systemd unit
# rather than a foreground process.
#
# The runner version is pinned here for this ephemeral EC2 runner. The
# persistent runner installer in scripts/runners/action-runners-setup.sh has
# its own version pin and is updated independently.
#
# The runner also refuses to run as root unless RUNNER_ALLOW_RUNASROOT=1 is
# set (GitHub's own safety check in run-helper.sh) -- required here since
# this AMI only reliably supports root SSH access (see provision.sh).
#
# The runner is installed to /opt (relabeled via restorecon) rather than the
# login user's home directory, and its EnvironmentFile lives under
# /etc/systemd/system/ -- both confirmed necessary on SELinux-enforcing AMIs
# (Rocky/RHEL family): systemd (running as the init_t domain) is denied read
# and execute access to files labeled admin_home_t, which is the default
# label for anything under /root or /home/*. This isn't optional hardening;
# without it the service fails at startup with "Permission denied" errors
# that have nothing to do with Unix file permissions.
#
# Required env vars:
#   SSH_KEY_PATH   path to the orchestrator's SSH private key
#   SSH_USER       SSH user on the box (from provision.sh output; must have
#                  passwordless sudo -- the default for cloud-init images)
#   PUBLIC_IP      the box's public IP (from provision.sh output)
#   JIT_CONFIG     base64 JIT config from verify-and-register.sh
#   KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE  the same run-specific known_hosts path provision.sh
#                  used to establish trust with this box -- see that
#                  script's header for why it's per-run, not shared
#
# Optional env vars:
#   RUNNER_VERSION   GitHub Actions runner version (default: 2.337.0)
#   RUNNER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  timeout waiting for the runner to report
#                    it has actually connected to GitHub (default 60). A
#                    systemd "active" unit only proves the process is still
#                    running, not that GitHub accepted it -- a deprecated
#                    RUNNER_VERSION (this has already happened once to the
#                    sibling scripts/runners/action-runners-setup.sh pin)
#                    still shows "active" while GitHub silently rejects it,
#                    which would otherwise leave the test job queued forever
#                    for a runner that can never pick it up.
